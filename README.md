# covidappb13
my first Repository, (my 4th attempt, hence why its called covidappb13)

This is my Corona Virus Tracking App.The app is called CovidAppB1 because that is the latest version of the app.

This application features up to date tracking on the globa Coronavirus pandemic. You can keep track of all the cases reported by John Hopkins University. You can also see all the reported cases by each individual country. 

Make sure to use the search toolbar to look up exactly what country you want to see.
